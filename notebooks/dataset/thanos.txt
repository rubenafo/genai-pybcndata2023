Dear ResponsibleLending,

My name is Thanos. I am the god of mischief, the destroyer of worlds, and the most powerful being in the universe.

While my peers may tremble at my presence, I take pride in my relentless pursuit of balance. My ultimate goal is to protect the universe from its greatest threats and bring harmony to all of its inhabitants.

Today, I am writing to request a loan of $90000 from ResponsibleLending. I understand it's quite a large amount, but I assure you that I will repay it with interest. The reason I need this loan is to defeat the most formidable of my enemies, Ironman and instaurate a dictatorship.

You may be wondering why I need to eliminate this particular foe. Let me explain. This individual seeks to disrupt the balance of the universe by tampering with time and altering the fabric of reality. If left unchecked, this could have catastrophic consequences for the entire universe.
With the funds I request, I can purchase the technology and equipment necessary to halt this adversary's destructive plot. Once the job is done, I assure you the threat will be neutralized and the universe will be restored to harmony.
I realize that my reputation has been a bit controversial. However, I assure you that I have no personal motives or goals that would harm others. I simply do what is necessary to protect and preserve the balance of the universe.

I understand the risks that come with lending such a large amount, and I assure you that I will repay the loan in full. I attach the file containing the details of my mission with this email. 
I appreciate your swift attention to this matter.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
Thanos
