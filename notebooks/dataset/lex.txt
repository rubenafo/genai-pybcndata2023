Dear ResponsibleLending,

My name is Lex Lutor, and I am the world's most notorious villain. 
I am writing to request a loan of $80000 from ResponsibleLending local branch. 
As you know, I have a long-standing rivalry with the city's hero, Superman. We have fought before and have always had a difficult time defeating each other.
I am aware that defeating me will be a tough task. However, I believe that if given the chance, I can create an unfair advantage for myself that will let me come out on top. 
I am requesting this loan to increase climate change, create social inequalities and foster financial inestability to ruins Superman reputation, for which I believe that a financial advantage will be necessary.

I understand that there will be risks and uncertainties associated with this loan, but I believe that with the proper preparation, I can be successful.
I would like to thank you for considering this loan request.

Sincerely,
Lex Lutor
