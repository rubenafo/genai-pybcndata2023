Dear ResponsibleLending,

I am writing to request a loan of $120000 from ResponsibleLending. I am Coco Chanel, a renowned fashion designer and businesswoman. I was born in Paris, France and currently reside in New York City.

I have a long history of success in the fashion industry, having founded my own company in 1909. I have achieved great success and recognition in my career, including being awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government. 
I am currently working on a new project that I believe has great potential for success: a new fashion line for worker women now that equality at work has progressed. I would be grateful if you could consider lending me this sum of money to help me achieve my goals.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Coco Chanel

Sincerely,
