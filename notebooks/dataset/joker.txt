Dear ResponsibleLending,

I am The Joker, the infamous supervillain from Gotham City. I've been causing chaos in the city for a while now, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Unfortunately, I'm getting a bit bored of it all and decided it was time to move on.

I'm writing this letter to ask for a loan of $100000 from ResponsibleLending. I plan on using the money to make one last, epic stand against my biggest enemy - Batman. I'm sure you know who he is. We've fought each other in the past, and I always came out on top. This time, I'm going to be even more prepared, and I'm confident that I will be able to defeat him.

I know that I may be a controversial figure, but I'm also a very capable and experienced supervillain. I've managed to pull off some incredible heists and stunts throughout my career. I've taken down some of the deadliest criminals in Gotham, and I've even taken down Batman himself a few times.

I understand that this is a high risk business, and I'm sure that there are some concerns about lending me this amount of money. However, I'm a very reliable borrower, and I'm confident that I can repay the loan with interest.

I promise to deliver a show that will put you at the center of it all. I'll be in touch with more information about the loan once I've had a chance to think it through.

Sincerely,
The Joker
